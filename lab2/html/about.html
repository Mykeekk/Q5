            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My Development began in 2000 by Thug Studios CEO, Jo Bryson alongside Thug Studios as they were making titles of the DreamyBull Games IP. The first thoughts of Ambatukam 4 were a game known Whirlwind Legacy, a first person fighting game, which later became the Turbulence games for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The second thoughts of Ambatukam 4 was an Ambatukam spin off known as Ambatukam: Ambasingh, which was about Ambatukamâ€™s brother, Ambasingh and finally the third thought was Ambatukam 4 known in development as Ambatukam: Codename Thug Hero. Which was announced in 2003 at E3 which featured a new design for Ambatukam and new weapons, which came to be as the Spirit Scythe and the Shadow Drum Gun and was planned to be released on September 21st, 2003 but was delayed due to low income from Ambatukam 3 and was pushed to October 2004 which got turned into the November 15th release.</p>
